# Legal & Compliance Framework - Nusantara Token

**DISCLAIMER:** This document provides general guidance only. It is NOT legal advice. PT Nusantara Digital Ventura MUST consult with qualified legal counsel familiar with Indonesian law and relevant international regulations.

## 1. Token Classification

### 1.1 Utility Token vs Security Token

**Our Position: UTILITY TOKEN**

#### Classification Rationale:

✅ **Pure Utility Functions:**
- Token provides access to platform features (not investment)
- Rewards for user activity (not profit-sharing)
- Fee discounts and premium access
- No promise of financial return

❌ **NOT a Security** (under Howey Test):
- ❌ No investment of money with expectation of profit
- ❌ No common enterprise for profit
- ❌ No reliance on efforts of others for profit
- ❌ No dividend or profit distribution

#### Howey Test Analysis:

| Criterion | Does NUSA Meet It? | Explanation |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------|
| Investment of money | ✅ Yes (users acquire tokens) | BUT: not determinative alone |
| Common enterprise | ❌ No | No pooling of funds for profit |
| Expectation of profit | ❌ No | Utility-focused, no ROI promise |
| Efforts of others | ❌ No | Value from utility, not team efforts |

**Conclusion:** NUSA is a **utility token**, not a security.

### 1.2 Indonesian Regulatory Context

#### Bappebti (Commodity Futures Trading Regulatory Agency)

**Relevant Regulations:**
- Bappebti Regulation No. 5/2019 (Crypto Asset as Commodity)
- Bappebti Regulation No. 8/2021 (Crypto Asset Trading)

**Key Points:**
1. **Crypto assets recognized as tradeable commodity** in Indonesia
2. **Trading must be through registered exchanges** (PFKA members)
3. **Token issuer obligations:**
   - Transparency in tokenomics
   - Risk disclosure
   - Clear terms of use

**Compliance Strategy:**
- [ ] Register token with PFKA-registered Indonesian exchanges
- [ ] Provide comprehensive risk disclosure (in Bahasa Indonesia)
- [ ] Maintain transparency in allocation & vesting

#### OJK (Financial Services Authority)

**Current Position (as of 2025):**
- OJK does NOT regulate crypto assets directly (Bappebti jurisdiction)
- HOWEVER: If token is deemed "security" → OJK jurisdiction
- If integrated with payment system → Bank Indonesia oversight

**Our Mitigation:**
- Token is pure utility (not security)
- Not a payment instrument (supplementary rewards)
- Clear documentation of non-security nature

---

### 1.3 International Regulatory Considerations

#### United States (SEC)

**If NUSA is offered to U.S. persons:**
- Must comply with SEC regulations
- Risk: SEC may classify as security despite utility function
- **Mitigation:**
  - Geographic blocking (exclude U.S. IPs)
  - Terms of Service: "Not available to U.S. persons"
  - No marketing to U.S. audience

#### European Union (MiCA Regulation)

**Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (effective 2024):**
- Requires white paper for crypto-asset offerings
- Consumer protection requirements
- **Compliance:**
  - Publish comprehensive token paper (✅ we have)
  - Risk warnings prominent
  - Issuer identification clear

#### Singapore (MAS)

**Payment Services Act:**
- If token is "digital payment token" → MAS license required
- **Our position:** NUSA is utility token, not DPT
- **Mitigation:** Not marketed as payment method

---

## 2. Risk Disclosure (Mandatory)

### 2.1 Standard Risk Warnings

**ALL marketing materials, website, and documentation MUST include:**

---

**⚠️ RISK DISCLOSURE ⚠️**

**IMPORTANT: READ CAREFULLY BEFORE ACQUIRING NUSA TOKENS**

1. **High Volatility:** NUSA token value may fluctuate significantly. You may lose some or all value.

2. **No Investment Guarantee:** NUSA is a utility token. It is NOT an investment. There is NO guarantee of profit or return.

3. **Regulatory Uncertainty:** Cryptocurrency regulations are evolving. Future regulations may adversely affect NUSA utility or tradability.

5. **Liquidity Risk:** There is no guarantee that NUSA will remain tradable or that liquidity will be sufficient.

6. **No Redemption Right:** PT Nusantara Digital Ventura is NOT obligated to buy back tokens.

7. **Platform Dependency:** Token utility depends on the continued operation of our platform. If the platform ceases operations, token utility may be lost.

8. **Jurisdiction Restrictions:** NUSA may not be available in certain jurisdictions. Users are responsible for compliance with local laws.

**BY ACQUIRING NUSA TOKENS, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTOOD, AND ACCEPTED THESE RISKS.**
